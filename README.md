# BrainScan.AI â€“ MRI-based Brain Tumor Detector

## Overview
BrainScan.AI is a deep learning-powered diagnostic tool that detects and classifies brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy. It supports early detection through automated image classification using advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs), helping medical professionals prioritize cases and improve diagnostic confidence.

## Problem Statement
Timely and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is critical for effective treatment planning. Manual MRI analysis can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error, especially in high-volume clinical settings. An AI-driven solution helps radiologists prioritize cases, reduce oversight, and provide consistent evaluation metrics across diverse patient populations.

## Solution
The system uses a sophisticated deep learning model to classify MRI brain scans into four categories: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. Our solution leverages state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques with significant improvements in model architecture and training methodology to ensure reliable clinical-grade performance.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Handling and Preprocessing
- **Advanced normalization** with pixel rescaling (0-1) for consistent model inputs
- **Medical imaging-specific data augmentation** using conservative transformations to preserve diagnostic features
- **Class distribution analysis** to identify and mitigate dataset imbalances through strategic sampling techniques
- **Comprehensive data validation** pipeline ensuring data integrity and quality

### Model Architecture
- **ResNet50V2 backbone** with transfer learning for superior feature extraction compared to standard ResNet50
- **Batch normalization layers** for more stable training and reduced internal covariate shift
- **Optimized dense layer configuration** with appropriate dropout rates to prevent overfitting
- **Multi-stage classification head** designed specifically for radiological image analysis

### Training Strategy
- **Two-stage training approach**:
  - Initial training of classification head with frozen backbone
  - Careful fine-tuning of entire model with discriminative learning rates
- **Adaptive learning rate scheduling** with ReduceLROnPlateau for optimal convergence
- **Enhanced early stopping** with increased patience (10 epochs) to avoid premature convergence
- **Class weight balancing** to handle inherent dataset imbalances common in medical imaging

### Evaluation Framework
- **Comprehensive metric suite** including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Confusion matrix visualization** for intuitive understanding of model performance across classes
- **ROC curve analysis** with area under curve (AUC) calculations for each diagnostic category
- **Detailed classification report** providing granular performance assessment

### Code Organization and Best Practices
- **Modular, well-documented functions** for enhanced readability and maintainability
- **Extensive result visualization** capabilities for model interpretation
- **Checkpoint system** to save and restore best-performing models
- **Clean separation** of data processing, model building, training, and evaluation phases

### Additional Enhancements
- **Optimized image dimensions** (224Ã—224) matching ResNet50V2's architecture requirements
- **Calibrated batch size** (16) for improved gradient updates and training stability
- **Streamlined model persistence** functionality for deployment readiness
- **Comprehensive visualization tools** for model performance analysis and interpretation
